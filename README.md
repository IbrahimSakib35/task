# Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System
 The Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System is a web-based platform designed to manage gym operations efficiently. It supports three roles: Admin, Trainer, and Trainee, each with specific permissions. Admins can manage trainers, schedule classes, and assign trainers. Trainers can view their schedules, and trainees can book classes. The system enforces business rules to ensure smooth operations and utilizes JWT-based authentication for secure access.
